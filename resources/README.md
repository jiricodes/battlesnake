## Algorithms

### [Automated Snake Game Solvers](https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/5/1894/files/2016/12/AutomatedSnakeGameSolvers.pdf)
[This paper](https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/5/1894/files/2016/12/AutomatedSnakeGameSolvers.pdf) tests 3 AI algorithms and 2 baseline methods for playing the Snake game. Includes brief description of each method and their relative success rates. Good place to start.
